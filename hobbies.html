    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <h2>My first hobby</h2>
    <p>
        My first hobby was cooking/baking, especially baking, it was my calling,
        it all started when i had just finished JSS 2 and i went for summer school
        at St. Catherine high school (i think that was the name of the school)   
        and we had to do catering and crafts, on that day, the teachers had decided we'd be 
        baking vanilla cupcakes and chin-chin (a popular nigerian treat), we also had to do some
        crafts but that's a story for another day.
    </p>
    <p>
        So when i had finished with my craft, i saw a group, struggling to decide who was going to mix
        the cake batter, i was intrigued, so i decided to join, i watched as they whipped the butter and sugar together,
        by hand too, adding all the dry ingredients and kneading the dough for the chin-chin, the whole experience
        was like discovering a new world for 12 year old me.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that day, i kept on pressuring my mom to buy me the materials to learn how to bake and surprisingly 
        my mom who would usually need a lot of convincing answered me rather easily. The first thing i made was the chin-chin,
        which i made under the supervision of my paternal grandmother and they came out amazing, the next thing i made was a vanilla cake and it did not 
        come out as good as the chin-chin, turns out my beginner's luck had run out, the cake was not the worst thing i'd ever eaten
        it was just really dense and overmixed. At the time i thought i was unstoppable and that there was nothing i couldn't bake,
        i definitely thought wrong.
    </p>
    <p>From then on, i just kept on honing the craft and i did eventually get better, in fact, i was so immersed in it
        that i created my very own recipe book, which i lost unfortunately, i'm sure you would've loved to see it.
    </p>
    <h2>My Second Major Hobby</h2>
    <p>
        It's dancing ta da, well this one began during a christmas holiday in 2021, the same year i got 
        into kpop, starting with BTS obviously. For my kpop fans, it was taehyung(v) who caught my intrest
        from a youtube ad from one of their promotional videos probably inkigayo(i'm not sure i got that right).
        Anyways, from there i got super intrested and i got to know all the other members and fell in love with their 
        individual charms and the songs, some of my favourites were run, dynamite and butter. I know, i know basic army
        right, well in my defense i wasn't an army for long, i was stolen away by the stays 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first straykids song i listened to was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57n4dZAPxNY">chrismas evel</a>
        and i fell in love with it, that was one of the worst christmas for me and my family so it felt like i could relate to 
        the song and it felt like my own personal present. then i kept on following them and found out stays are literally
        just funny crackheads, i really loved my time as a stay, i learnt all the choreos, i had even planned to perform them 
        at a youth convention that i used to go to every year but it was cancelled that year. However, my passion for dancing
        did not die i kept on dancing and learning choreos from other groups especially Enhypen and NCT. 
    </p>
    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        There are many things i also like doing but i wouldn't consider them hobbies, for example 
        i love having good results from my school papers, i love coming up with ideas/solutions for my 
        problems in ways that can be monetized for my gain. I'll update you on any new hobbies i pick up 
        as i continue to journey through life.<br />
        And since you really wanted to know more about me and came all this way, i'll give you something 
        others won't get ;)
